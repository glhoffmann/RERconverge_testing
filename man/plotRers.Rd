\title{Plot the residuals reflecting the relative evolutionary rates (RERs) of a gene across
species present in the gene tree}
\usage{
plotRers(
  rermat = NULL,
  index = NULL,
  phenv = NULL,
  rers = NULL,
  species_from = NULL,
  species_to = NULL,
  method = "k",
  xlims = NULL,
  plot = 1,
  xextend = 0.2,
  sortrers = F
)
}
\arguments{
\item{rermat.}{A residual matrix, output of the getAllResiduals() function}

\item{index.}{A character denoting the name of gene, or a numeric value corresponding to the gene's row index in the residuals matrix}

\item{phenv.}{A phenotype vector returned by \code{\link{tree2Paths}} or \code{\link{foreground2Paths}}}

\item{species_from/species_to.}{Name translations: two vectors of equal length with corresponding elements. The function will translate any occurrence of species_from[n] to species_to[n] (if applicable).}
}
\value{
A plot of the RERs with foreground species labelled in red, and the rest in blue
}
\description{
Plot the residuals reflecting the relative evolutionary rates (RERs) of a gene across
species present in the gene tree
